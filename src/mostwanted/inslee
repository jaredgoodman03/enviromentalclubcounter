Hi! My name is ______ and I am a student at [your school] in [your city]. I am calling to ask Governor Inslee to spend more time addressing the issue of climate change. May I please speak with Governor Inslee about this?
Hello Governor Inslee, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. My name is _____ and I am a student at [your school] in Washington. As you know, my generation is facing devastating consequences thanks to the inaction by Congress  surrounding climate change however we believe that with a strong voice advocating for legislation ending climate change, we can move forward. We are asking you to please address this problem, because when my generation comes to power it may be too late. We recognize that you have spent time attempting to address climate change however we feel that it is necessary that you "walk the walk" rather than simply "talk the talk". We respect your commitment to ending climate change.
Would you be able to take a message for me? Thanks. <br> I am calling to ask you to make climate change a more central part of your presidential campaign. My generation is facing devastating consequences thanks to the inaction by Congress. However, we believe that with a strong voice advocating for legislation ending climate change, we can move forward. We are asking you to please address this problem, because when my generation comes to power it may be too late.
