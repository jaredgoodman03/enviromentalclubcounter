Hi! My name is ______ and I am a student at [your city] in [your town]. I am calling to ask Senator Sanders to spend more time addressing the issue of climate change. May I please speak with Senator Sanders about this?
Hello Senator Sanders, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. Ny name is _____ and I am a student at The Overlake School in Washington. I am calling to ask you to make climate change a more central part of your presidential campaign. My generation is facing devastating consequences thanks to the inaction by Congress. However, we believe that with a strong voice advocating for legislation ending climate change, we can move forward. We are asking you to please address this problem, because when my generation comes to power it may be too late.
