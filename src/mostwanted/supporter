Hello, _____! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. Ny name is _____ and I am a student at [your school] in Washington. I am calling to ask you to make climate change a more central part of your legislative agenda. My generation is facing devastating consequences thanks to the inaction by the United States Government however we believe that with a strong voice advocating for legislation ending climate change, we can move forward. We are asking you to please address this problem, because when my generation comes to power it may be too late.
