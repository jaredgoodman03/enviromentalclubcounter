President Donald Trump
(202) 456-1111
​Hi! My name is ______ and I am a student from the state of Washington. I’m calling to ask President Trump to recognize that climate change is a real and pressing threat to America. May I please speak with the President or an aide?
Hi President Trump, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I’m calling to ask you to stop denying the extreme danger of climate change, and to take action against it. Despite overwhelming evidence and consensus among scientists, you continue to pretend that human-driven climate change is nonexistent or just weather. Your own administration released a report finding that climate change threatens [quote] “the health and wellbeing of the American people”. This planet is our future. With the power of running a nation comes the fundamental responsibility of protecting that future, for the youth and for all. You talk about putting America first, yet you call global warming a “hoax”. We have 12 years, just 12 years, to make major changes before global warming becomes devastating, killing millions upon millions of people. Who will be living in this future? American citizens. Your children. Why do you continue to threaten the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of Americans? <br> [Take it from here]

Your children. Please, get your head out of the ground and get moving towards reform that will protect our people rather than result in irreversible destruction and lost lives.
