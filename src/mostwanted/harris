Hi! My name is ______ and I am a student at [your school] in [your town]. I am calling to ask Senator Harris to spend more time addressing the issue of climate change. May I please speak with Senator Harris about this?
Hello Senator Harris, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. My name is _____ and I am a student at [your school] in Washington. I am calling to ask you to make climate change a more central part of your presidential campaign. My generation is facing devastating consequences thanks to the inaction by Congress however we believe that with a strong voice advocating for legislation ending climate change, we can move forward. We are asking you to please address this problem, because when my generation comes to power it may be too late.
